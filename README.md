# working-docker-containers
Here are some working docker containers that can help others build useful projects.

I hope to create working "hello world" apps for each popular language or framework.

It's sometimes tricky to get the files right.

Basically, to create a container you need.
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Docker Desktop
- Docker Desktop Installer.exe -> https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2) Docker Compose File
- docker-compose.yml

3) Dockerfile File
- Dockerfile

4) A bunch of other files, dependencies, commands and patience.
------------------------------------------------------------

I'm providing these to anyone that might need them, including myself in the future.

Feel free to inform me of improvements and optimizations.

Thank you!
